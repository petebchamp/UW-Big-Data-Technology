# UW-Big-Data-Technology

In June 2020 I completed a certificate program in Big Data Technology through the University of Washington (https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/big-data-technologies).

Most exercises were done using Spark through Azure Databricks (in both Python and Scala), while also including such big data tools as Kafka, NiFi, Docker, Azure Data Lake, Azure Event Hub, CosmosDB, Delta Lake, and MLFLow.
